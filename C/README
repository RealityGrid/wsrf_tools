The directory containing this README should contain the source code for
a number of utilities for use with the WSRF-based version of the
RealityGrid steering library (www.realitygrid.org and 
www.sve.man.ac.uk/Research/AtoZ/RealityGrid/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
To build:

You'll need the RealityGrid steering library installed somewhere
on your machine.

Ensure that the REG_STEER_HOME environment variable holds the path to the
steering library, e.g. ${HOME}/reg_steer_lib.
(In bash:
	export REG_STEER_HOME=${HOME}/reg_steer_lib 
and in (t)csh:
	setenv REG_STEER_HOME ${HOME}/reg_steer_lib
.)

The Makefile is set up to use gcc.  If you're using some other compiler
you'll need to change it.

Type 'make'...
Type 'make install'... this creates a 'tools.conf' file in ~/.realitygrid. 
Edit this file to specify the location of the top-level job registry etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The utilities:

---------------------
addUser

  Usage:
    addUser <address of SWS> <passphrase> <username to add>

  Allow another user access to the specified SWS.  The passphrase
  securing the SWS must be specified, along with the username of the
  new user.

---------------------
browseRegistry

  Usage:
    browseRegistry [--registry=EPR of Registry]  [--pattern=pattern to filter on]

  Browse a specified registry (WSRF ServiceGroup).  If either argument
  is not specified, the file ~/.realitygrid/tools.conf will be checked
  for appropriate values.

---------------------
createChkTree

  Usage:
    createChkTree [--factory=address of checkpoint tree factory]
                  <--label=description of work to be recorded in this tree>

  Creates a new CheckpointTree using the specified factory and with a 
  label containing the specified descriptive text.  If no factory is specified 
  then the file ~/.realitygrid/tools.conf will be checked for a valid factory EPR.

---------------------
createSWS

  Usage:
    createSWS [--registry=address of registry] [--lifetime=lifetime (min)]
              [--appName=name of application] <--purpose=purpose of job> 
              [--checkpoint=EPR of starting checkpoint if any]
              [--dataSource=label of source IOType]
              [--proxy=address:port]

  Create a Steering Web Service.  This takes four mandatory arguments
  (address of the 'top level registry', run-time of the job in minutes,
  the name of the application being run and some [quoted] text
  describing its purpose) and one optional argument - the EPR of the node in
  a checkpoint tree from which the job is being restarted.  If the mandatory
  arguments are not given on the command line, the file 
  ~/.realitygrid/tools.conf will be checked for appropriate values.

---------------------
createVisSWS

  As for createSWS but for use when the associated app. is a visualization
  and thus must be supplied with a data source.  The simulation that will
  act as a data source must be up and running before using this utility.

---------------------
destroySWS

  Usage:
    destroySWS <EPR of SWS 1> [<EPR of SWS 2>...]

  Destroys one or more specified SWSs.

---------------------
getResourceProperty

  Usage:
    getResourceProperty <EPR of SWS> <name of ResourceProperty>

  Retrieves the value of the specified ResourceProperty from the SWS at the
  specified address.

---------------------
getResourcePropertyDoc

  Usage:
    getResourcePropertyDoc <EPR of SWS>

  Retrieves the complete ResourceProperties document from the SWS at the
  specified address.

---------------------
globalParamCreate

  Usage: 
    globalParamCreate <EPR of parent>

  Use to create 'global' steered parameters for a steered couple model.  
  Takes a single argument consisting of the EPR of the parent SWS representing
  the complete coupled model.  This SWS is interrogated to get the EPRs of
  its children and its parameter defintions.  These parameters are
  then displayed to the user who can choose which to link together in order 
  to create a 'global' parameter.  Once done, the definitions of the global 
  parameters are passed back to the parent EPR.

  N.B. This requires that the parent SWS have the parameter definitions from
  all of its children which in turn requires that all the children be up
  and running before this tool is used.
